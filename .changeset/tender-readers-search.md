'@nl-design-system-candidate/link-tokens': major
---

This release contains **breaking** changes.

The following tokens were never used in the community and have been removed:

- `nl.link.active.text-decoration-line`
- `nl.link.active.text-decoration-thickness`

We are working towards common design tokens that take care of the focus state instead of handling this at the component level. Therefore the following focus related tokens have been removed:

- `nl.link.focus-visible.background-color`
- `nl.link.focus-visible.color`
- `nl.link.focus-visible.text-decoration-line`
- `nl.link.focus-visible.text-decoration-thickness`
