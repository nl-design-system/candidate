# @nl-design-system-candidate/link-tokens

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- f8a16bf: This release contains **breaking** changes.

  The following tokens were never used in the community and have been removed:

  - `nl.link.active.text-decoration-line`
  - `nl.link.active.text-decoration-thickness`

  We are working towards common design tokens that take care of the focus state instead of handling this at the component level. Therefore the following focus related tokens have been removed:

  - `nl.link.focus-visible.background-color`
  - `nl.link.focus-visible.color`
  - `nl.link.focus-visible.text-decoration-line`
  - `nl.link.focus-visible.text-decoration-thickness`
